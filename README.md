# component-lib
This is an idea for a component library for React projects using Vite + TypeScript

## Getting started

### Run development server

Running the `npm run dev`command to run a development server with a simple App showcasing the components.

### Build dist package

Running the `npm run build`command creates a `dist` folder containing two javascript compiled versions of the components package.

## Roadmap

* Create more components
* Adding Tailwind for styling
* Coding style rules(similar to AI Studio)
